## get_jolt

`get_jolt` is an **experimental repository that only focuses on GetX's reactive / state-management layer**.  
It replaces GetX's `Rx` family types with a `JoltSignal`-based implementation (from `jolt_flutter`) to evaluate how a signal-style model feels when used with familiar GetX patterns.

> **This will not be published to pub.dev.** If you really want to use it, do so **carefully** via a git dependency. This repo is for experimentation and validation only.
